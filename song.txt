    What a wonderful World
I see trees of green, red roses too
I see them bloom for me and You

And I think to Myself what a wonderful World!

I see skies of blue, and clouds of white
The bright blessed day, the dark sacred night
And I think to myself what a wonderful World!

The colours of a rainbow, so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces of people going by
I see friends shaking hands saying ho do you do
They're really saying Ilove you!

I hear babies crying, I watch them grow
They'll learn much more than I'll never know
And I think to myself what a wonderful world!
Yes! I think to myself what a wonderful World!
UUUU..Yeah!!!
